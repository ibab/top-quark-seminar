The paper\cite{kaplan}

% Look at jet substructure to distinguish tops from quarks/gluons
% Impose kinematic constraints on subjets
% All-hadronic channel becomes possible
% Most are created at threshold
% But some are highly boosted (esp. looking at new physics)
% In that case, b-tagging difficult
