The article\cite{ilc} is a white paper detailing in how far an International Linear Collider (ILC) could provide opportunities for performing precision measurements of the top quark.
The ILC would be a linear electron-positron collider with possible center-of-mass energies exceeding that of two top quarks.
The main process considered by the authors is $e^+e^-\to t\overline{t}$.
The ILC would be the first experiment to allow the study of top quarks using a precisely defined leptonic initial state, meaning that top quark properties could be measured using an initial state with defined center-of-mass energy and electron polarizations.

% problem for precise cms energy: radiation
% special emphasis on theory: What can we already calculate precisely, what needs to be improved?
% σ(sqrt(s)) prediction
% Interesting measurement: Couplings of top to γ/Z
% We want measure form factors -> use different polarizations -> like LEP physics
% How many events will the ILC see? -> 100,000 with 500fb^-1, almost no background
% Precision of couplings up to 1%
% Studies of ILC sensitivity on form factors
