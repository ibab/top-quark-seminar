The paper\cite{atlas} is a recent analysis exploring an ATLAS dataset taken during 2012 (with $\SI{20}{fb}^{-1}$) for the presence of new, vector-like heavy quarks.
Such new quarks can have a top-like charge (referred to as $T$) or a bottom-like charge ($B$).
The analysis specifically looks for the decay modes $T\to Zt$ and $B\to Zb$.
Both pair and single production of $T$ and $B$ are investigated.

% Why vector-like quarks?
% How do we search for vector-like quarks?

The presence of a $Z$ boson is inferred by combining a pair of muons or electrons with opposite charges and checking if their invariant mass is within \SI{10}{GeV} of the known $Z$ mass.

In addition, the $t$ and $b$ quarks need to be considered:
While the presence of a $b$ quark can be detected via a $b$-jet, the decaying top quark can produce further leptons (the trilepton case) and further $b$-jets.

Both signal and background events are simulated using a variety of Monte Carlo generators.
Important background final states that needed to be modeled were $Z + $jets and $Z + q\overline{q} +$ jets, as well as $WZ$, $ZZ$, $WW$ for the trilepton case.

Variables that are useful for the selection are the $Z$ boson transverse momentum

Finally, the authors conclude that no sufficient evidence for different models of $T$ and $B$ could be observed.
Lower limits on the masses of $T$ and $B$ (depending on the respective model) could be set at roughly \SI{700}{GeV}.
